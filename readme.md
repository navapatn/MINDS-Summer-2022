# Course Projects

## Project 1
Path-Finding Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A\*) in a 3D maze <br />
![3D Maze](./image/3D_maze.png)
<br />
For this assignment we applied AI search techniques to solve sophisticated 3D mazes. Each 3D maze is a grid of points with (x,y,z) locations, there are 18 actions our agent can make (see assignment pdf for more details). The program should output the optimal path (according to the search algorithm).

## Project 2
Little-GO agent on a 5x5 GO board <br />

<br />
This assignment was open-ended and allowed us to use any search, game playing, or reinforcement learning technique we desired. I decided to implement Alpha-Beta Pruning search.

Note: I wanted to try using Q-learning and estimating the function using Neural Network, but with time constraint I did not end up trying it

## Project 3
Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Neural Network from scratch using MNIST dataset
<br />
![MNIST](./image/mnist.png)
<br />
implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and use it to classify hand-written digits shown from scratch (machine learning libraries are NOT allowed (including
tensorflow (v1&v2), caffe, pytorch, torch, cxxnet, and mxnet)

## Project 4
Kaggle Competition by H&M Group - CSCI 567
--- work in progress
